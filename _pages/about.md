* science nerd attempting to understand biology and chemistry
* currently working as a project scientst at IIT Delhi
* graduated with a master's in biotechnology (spec. in genetic engineering)
* reads fiction in the day, browses reddit at night (listens to Zayn in b/w)
* quite interested in discussing technology and philosophy (w/ a cup of tea)
